Hypify
======

Based off https://github.com/fzakaria/HypeMachine-Extension,
an excellent hype machine extension that adds a quick download button for tracks.


Chrome extension to add a read-only (for now) button on Hype Machine to indicate that the track exists in Spotify's database.
Queries are made using Spotify's metadata api.

I made this extension because I'm an avid user of spotify, but use hype machine for all of my music discovery.
Ultimately I'd like to be able to add straight to a playlist etc, but right now the api does not support that.

It's super easy to install the extension by following these steps:

1 - Download the ZIP and extract it

2 - Go to Options -> Tools -> Extensions (Chrome wrench button)

3 - Enable Developer Mode

4 - Click Load Unpacked Extension and select unzipped folder

5 - A magnifying glass will now be positioned to the right of the play button to indicate that a spotify version was found!
