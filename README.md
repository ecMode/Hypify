Hypify
======

Based off https://github.com/fzakaria/HypeMachine-Extension,
an excellent hype machine extension that adds a quick download button for tracks.

Chrome extension to add an icon on Hype Machine to indicate that the indicated track exists in Spotify's database.
Queries are made using Spotify's metadata api.

It's super easy to install the extension by following these steps:

1 - Download the ZIP and extract it

2 - Go to Options -> Tools -> Extensions (Chrome wrench button)

3 - Enable Developer Mode

4 - Click Load Unpacked Extension and select unzipped folder

5 - A magnifying glass will now be positioned to the right of the play button to indicate that a spotify version was found!
